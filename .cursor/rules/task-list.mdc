# Task list Management

Guidelines for creating and manageing task list in markdown files to track project progress

## Task List Creation

1. Create task list in a markdown file (in the project root):
    - Use 'TASK.md' or a descriptive name relevant to the feature (e.g., 'ASSISTANT_CHAT.md')
    - Include a clear title and description of the feature being implemented

2. Structure the file with these sections:

    '''markdown
    # Feature Name Implementation

    Brief description of the feature and its purpose.

    ## Completed Task

    - [x] Task 1 that has been completed
    - [x] Task 1 that has been completed

    ## In progress task

    - [ ] Task 3 currently being worked on
    - [ ] Task 4 to be completed soon

    ## Future task

    - [ ] Task 5 planned for future implementation
    - [ ] Task 6 planned for future implementation

    ## Implementation Plan
